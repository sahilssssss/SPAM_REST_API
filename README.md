### Project Highlights

**Developed a REST API for spam checking** using Django and PostgreSQL, enabling functionalities like user registration, marking phone numbers as spam, and performing searches by name or phone number.

**Implemented secure user authentication** with password hashing and role-based access using Django's custom user model.

**Designed and optimized database schemas** with PostgreSQL, including four relational tables: Users, Contacts, Spam, and SpamMarkedBy, to efficiently store and manage data.

**Created advanced search features**:
   - Search by name with prioritization for names starting with the query.
   - Search by phone number, supporting multiple contacts for the same number.

**Built scalable and reusable API endpoints** using Django Rest Framework (DRF), adhering to RESTful principles.

**Ensured API reliability** by handling edge cases and validating input data for all endpoints.

**Integrated database population scripts** to seed sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.
